Bootstrap-Password-Strength
===========================

Changes colour of password text box according to the password rules.  Uses the Twitter Bootstrap colours for errors.

Textboxes take the twitter bootstrap inheritted styles but you can leave out the bootstrap stuff to use your own formatting and keep the text box changing.

Still to do
-----------
More than is done..

Rules
-----
Could do with being better - clearer - easier to define.
Tried using jquery validate add rules but it wouldnt play ball - if anyone wants to help..

Issues
------
Doesnt work in IE for some effed up reason
